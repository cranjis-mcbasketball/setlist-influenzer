## Heading ##
  > Setlist Influenzer

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Help your favorite artists plan the perfect post-COVID-19 comeback tours.

## Summary ##
  > Since all of your favorite bands cancelled their shows this year due to COVID-19, they will have tons of extra time to plan their comeback tours. This app lets you as the fan influence their future setlists, which will make the comeback tour more enjoyable than the original tour would have been.

## Problem ##
  > So many fans wait for 8+ hours outside the venue to secure a spot at the barricade at their favorite band's show, only to hear 0 of their top 5 -- even top 10 -- favorite songs by the band.

## Solution ##
  > This app ensures that participating bands are aware of what their fans want to hear and at which particular shows. The app's algorithm calculates the average setlist based on song-choice frequency and placement for each individual tour date, so the band can take a look and decide if they'd like to make any changes to the set to please their fans.

## Quote from You ##
  >"'Setlist Influenzer' is just one of many ways to pass the time when the cabin fever really starts to kick in. Just like everybody else, I recently started noticing the emails rolling in about artists from all the 2020 shows I had planned cancelling their 2020 tour dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and rescheduling for a future TBD time (which was a very smart thing to do don't get me wrong). As a result I decided to make an app that will let the fans themselves help make the comeback tour even better than the original tour would have been.

## How to Get Started as the Client ##
  > Simply enter the band you'd like to see in the search bar, and select the tour date you plan on attending from the search results. Then, fill out the form -- one song per line -- with the songs you would like to hear them play in that order.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "You see, I grew up in the mid 90's and saw blink-182 during Cheshire Cat-era before they were popular, so I am understandably disappointed that they only play their new not-as-good stuff. Although this app didn't bring Tom back to blink (nor did it fix his poorly maintained voice), it DID cause the current lineup to start adding some of their classic hits such as "Ben Wah Balls", "Wasting Time", and "Carousel" back to the setlist! All thanks 'Setlist Influenzer'!"
