There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Setlist Influenzer

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Help your favorite artists plan the perfect post-COVID-19 comeback tours.

## Summary ##
  > Since all of your favorite bands cancelled their shows this year due to COVID-19, they will have tons of extra time to plan their comeback tours. This app lets you as the fan influence their future setlists, which will make the comeback tour more enjoyable than the original tour would have been.

## Problem ##
  > So many fans wait for 8+ hours outside the venue to secure a spot at the barricade at their favorite band's show, only to hear 0 of their top 5 -- even top 10 -- favorite songs by the band.

## Solution ##
  > This app ensures that participating bands are aware of what their fans want to hear and at which particular shows. The app's algorithm calculates the average setlist based on song-choice frequency and placement for each individual tour date, so the band can take a look and decide if they'd like to make any changes to the set to please their fans.

## Quote from You ##
  >"'Setlist Influenzer' is just one of many ways to pass the time when the cabin fever really starts to kick in. Just like everybody else, I recently started noticing the emails rolling in about artists from all the 2020 shows I had planned cancelling their 2020 tour dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and rescheduling for a future TBD time (which was a very smart thing to do don't get me wrong). As a result I decided to make an app that will let the fans themselves help make the comeback tour even better than the original tour would have been.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  > Simply enter the band you'd like to see in the search bar, and select the tour date you plan on attending from the search results. Then, fill out the form -- one song per line -- with the songs you would like to hear them play in that order.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "You see, I grew up in the mid 90's and saw blink-182 during Cheshire Cat-era before they were popular, so I am understandably disappointed that they only play their new not-as-good stuff. Although this app didn't bring Tom back to blink (nor did it fix his poorly maintained voice), but it DID cause the current lineup to start adding some of their classic hits such as "Ben Wah Balls", "Wasting Time", and "Carousel" back to the setlist! All thanks 'Setlist Influenzers'!"
